Demo of how to use user defined classes for simple data types.
Allows for compile time polymophic code generation.
Allows for data type association mappings.
Allows for the definition of the value domains for the data types.
Allows for the iteration/enumeration over domain keys.
Allows for pointer reference complition based on object types.

Following is the out from the program
A domain
1,2,3
next after A(2) a3
refsa1,b2
find A(1) a1
find ab a1b2
